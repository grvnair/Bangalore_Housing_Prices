# Bangalore_Housing_Prices
Developed a Machine Learning model to predict the house prices on Bangalore Housing Prices Dataset. 

Used Pandas and Numpy to clean the data and handle missing values.
Visualized the important features that impacted the price using matplotlib and used mean and one standard deviation to remove outliers in order to make the model efficient.
Used methods like Dimensionality reduction to preprocess the data before one hot encoding.
Used sklearn to split the data into train and test. Built a model Using Linear Regression.
To test the modelâ€™s accuracy, used K Fold cross Validation.
In order to test other algorithms to reach a better efficiency, used GridSearchCV and tested the model against, Lasso regression and Decision Tree Regressor.
Exported the model to a pickle file using the pickle library.
